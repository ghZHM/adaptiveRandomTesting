# Adaptive Random Testing
MSc dissertation project at the university of Sheffield: **Testing and Diversity**

# Overview
1.Implement *Adaptive random testing by **static partitioning*** proposed by Sabor K K and Thiel S.

2.Implement *Adaptive Random Testing incorporating a **local search technique*** by Schneckenburger C and Schweiggert F.

3.Implement Select Test From Candidate. Distribution and Select Strategy from Candidate Set can be modify [here](https://github.com/ghZHM/adaptiveRandomTesting/blob/master/src/com/company/Main.java#L101) .

And **Random Testing** as baseline.

The result printed in .csv contains F-measure and multiple metrics to evaluate test case distribution.

# Parameter adjustment

Failure Region is block pattern and failure rate, size of input domain can be adjust [here](https://github.com/ghZHM/adaptiveRandomTesting/blob/master/src/com/company/Main.java#L16).
