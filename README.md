MSc dissertation project at the University of Sheffield: **Testing and Diversity**

# Overview
1. Implement *Adaptive random testing by **static partitioning*** proposed by Sabor K K. and Thiel S.

2. Implement *Adaptive Random Testing incorporating a **local search technique*** by Schneckenburger C and Schweiggert F.

And **Random Testing** as the baseline.

The result printed in .csv contains F-measure and multiple metrics to evaluate test case distribution.

# Parameter adjustment
